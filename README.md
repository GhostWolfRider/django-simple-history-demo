### What is django-simple-history Doing Behind the Scenes?

The table with historical prepended to document are a table created by django-simple-history. These tables store every change that you make to the document table. Every time a create, update, or delete occurs on Document a new row is created in the historical document table including all of the fields in the instance of the document model, as well as other metadata:

 
    history_user: the user that made the create/update/delete
    history_date: the DateTime at which the create/update/delete occurred
    history_change_reason: the reason the create/update/delete occurred (null by default)
    history_id: the primary key for the historical table (note the base tableâ€™s primary key is not unique on the historical table since there are multiple    versions of it on the historical table)
    history_type: + for create, ~ for update, and - for delete

#### Install:
```
pip install django-simple-history
```
#### settings.py:
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [...
                  'simple_history',
                  ...
                  ]

MIDDLEWARE = [...
              'simple_history.middleware.HistoryRequestMiddleware',
              ...
              ]
SIMPLE_HISTORY_HISTORY_ID_USE_UUID = True
```

#### models.py:
```
from simple_history.models import HistoricalRecords

class Document(models.Model):
    ...
    history = HistoricalRecords(
                  history_id_field=models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4)
              )
```
By adding HistoricalRecords to a model or registering a model using the register, you automatically start tracking any create, update, or delete that occurs on that model.

#### Track History for a Third-Party Model:
```
from simple_history import register
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

register(User)
```

#### Run Migrations:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

#### Existing Projects:
```
python manage.py populate_history --auto
```
It creates the document_historicaldocument table for the document model.

    document_document

    document_historicaldocument
